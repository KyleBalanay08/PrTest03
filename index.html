    I am currently living at <ins><mark> Bryg. #22 San Guillermo, San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte</mark></ins>. 
    I am a BSInTech Computer technology student at Mariano Marcos State University College of Industrial Technology.
    My Nickname is <mark>"<ins>Kalbo</ins>"</mark> I don't know why they called me Kalbo, because I have curly hair so they called me Kalbo?
    I don't know, maybe? My mother is a Housewife and my father is a farmer. I have a sister and a brother.
    
    My hobbies is <mark>playing basketball</mark> and <mark>playing different online games</mark> after going to school. 
    My motto in life is <i style="color: aquamarine"><ins>"The best way to predict your future, is to create it"</ins></i>. 
    We will not be going successful, if we do not experience how hard life is. I will do my best, 
    no matter how hard so that I will achieve my desired dreams.
